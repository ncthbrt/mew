# WESL Tools

**A work in progress!**

This project will implement the necessary tools to build complex shaders, like [naga_oil](https://github.com/bevyengine/naga_oil) does for [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), but in a framework-agnostic way. At [wgsl-tooling-wg](https://github.com/wgsl-tooling-wg), we aim at standardizing a few language extensions to facilitate the work of engine developers and shader wizards.

This will be the home of a few wgsl source manipulation tools:

* A *syntax tree*, allows representing wgsl source.
* A *parser*, converts source to the syntax tree and provides human-readable error messages.
* (TODO) A *bundler* that produces a single WESL file from a set of input files and their local dependencies.
* (TODO) A *checker*, verify that a wgsl code is correct.
* (TODO) Various implementations of wgsl language extensions, the first ones will be imports and generics.

## Goals

* *Correct*, mirror concepts present in [the wgsl spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/).
* *Flexible*, allow extending the wgsl syntax with well-defined extensions (see [wgsl-tooling-wg](https://github.com/wgsl-tooling-wg)).
* *User-friendly*, by sticking to the spec as much as possible, by providing clear and well-documented interfaces.

## Non-goals

* *Performant*, we care about correctness, less so about time and memory constraints. The interface must be as user-friendly as possible. These tools target offline compilation first.
